# bublesort
Here is the code written in python, which sorts the numbers 'bubbles'
Algorithm
The algorithm consists of repeating passes through the sorted array. At each iteration, neighboring elements are sequentially compared, and if the order in the pair is incorrect, then the elements are reversed. For each pass through the array, at least one element falls into place, so it is necessary to make no more than nâˆ’1 passes, where n is the size of the array to sort the array.
